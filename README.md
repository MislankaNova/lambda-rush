# lambda-rush
Shooting game written in Rust, with trace amounts of Haskell and Lisp.

Made during ICHack17.

# Why?

Because monadic bind operator (>>=) in Haskell looks cool so I thought that it would be great to be a part of my game graphics.

# How?

I started writing a shooting game a few weeks ago, from which I borrowed most codes of lambda-rush. The game is written in Rust, which is both highly efficient and fault-proof, ie. no time wasted solving segmentation faults. For the graphical part I used SFML which provided a nice layer of abstraction over openGL and such.

# Anything Else?

No.
